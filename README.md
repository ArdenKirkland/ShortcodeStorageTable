# ShortcodeStorageTable
Omeka shortcode to insert a table with storage locations and other basic metadata. This can be put in a SimplePage (or anywhere  you can setup a shortcode) for viewing or printing. 

The HTML display uses an Item Type Metadata field called "Storage Location" along with the Dublin Core Identifier, Title, and Description fields.
